# Hello, World!
**Job title**: Senior talent accusation (I apply to job postings, hoping they acquire me as their talent).

# Currently learning
- Operating system development: So I rack up another way to cope with unemployment
- Machine Learning and AI: Hoping my machine finally learns how to automatically insert a semicolon at rendering.c:553:14
- Next.js: Vercel makes amazing CI/CD, infra, build system, monorepo software. Now the last thing they need is a good frontend library
- Emacs: Emacs is a great operating system, waiting for them to release a good editor
