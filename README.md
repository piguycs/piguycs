# Hello, World!
**Job title**: Senior talent accusation (I apply to job postings, hoping they acquire me as their talent).

# Currently learning
- Operating system development: So I rack up another way to cope with unemployment
- Machine Learning and AI: Hoping my machine finally learns how to automatically insert a semicolon at `rendering.c:553:14`
- Next.js: Vercel has built the best development ecosystem with their infrastructure, build system, and serverless functions. Now I am waiting for them to ship a good frontend library
- Kyne's peace, Clear skies and Whirlwind Spirit
